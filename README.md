**Convolutional Neural Network **
 Within Deep Learning, a Convolutional Neural Network or CNN is a type of artificial neural network, which is widely used for image/object recognition and classification. Deep Learning thus recognizes objects in an image by using a CNN. CNNs are playing a major role in diverse tasks/functions like image processing problems, computer vision tasks like localization and segmentation, video analysis, to recognize obstacles in self-driving cars, as well as speech recognition in natural language processing. As CNNs are playing a significant role in these fast-growing and emerging areas, they are very popular in Deep Learning.
 
 The repository contains the file of code in which I have used the squential algorithm of CNN. Following are the libaraies used in the code:
 1. Numpy
 2. tensorflow 
 3. Sklearn metrices 
 4. Matplotlib 
 
 For the data, I have used the kaggle data of natural scenes. In google colab, using kaggle API, downloaded the data.
 Following is the data:
